All public orx functions have been exported to AngelScript and that allows you to edit and debug an entire game written in AngelScript for fast prototyping.
Later, if you want, you can easily port the game in C or C++ since AngelScript is really similar.
You could use AngelScript JIT compiler too to have a near-native performance of the script.
